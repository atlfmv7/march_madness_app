# seed_data.py
# -------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Seed (or reset and seed) the database with a compact demo bracket so you can
#   verify the UI and bracket propagation logic end-to-end.
#
# What this script does:
#   - Clears existing Participants, Teams, and Games (idempotent while iterating).
#   - Creates 8 sample Participants (P1..P8).
#   - Creates 8 sample Teams split across two regions (East/West) and assigns
#     both initial and current owners round-robin so the UI has ownership data.
#   - NEW: Creates two Round of 32 (r32) *skeleton* Game records (one per region).
#     These have no teams yet; Round of 64 winners will auto-advance into these.
#   - Creates four Round of 64 (r64) Game records (two per region) with spreads
#     and favorites for simple rendering.
#   - NEW: Links the four r64 games to their corresponding r32 game targets via
#     next_game_id and next_game_slot so propagation is well-defined.
#
# Notes:
#   - We commit once after creating r32 games to ensure they have primary keys,
#     then create r64 games, set their next links, and commit again.
#   - Times are synthetic for demonstration; replace with real schedule data later.
